extract names inside quotations and also look at the error after that. There would be different actions if the error is "No such file and directory" and "Not a directory"

extract name just before ": No such file and directory" -> this error indicates there is no such file and directory

extract name before ": Not a directory" -> indicates there is a '/' appended in the name. So search for a directory with this name in other directories

REGEX TO EXTRACT THE DIR OR FILE NAME
-------------------------------------
move from right to left and select the first quotation (‘’) found and return. if not found then again move from right to left and select the word just before to first `:`. For file command it encloses the filename inside `'

Now find the file or dir with the found name and repeat the command in while loop until success
