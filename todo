I give preference to ftype="d" (the $err string always contains directory word after file word. So ftype is set to 'd'). But this may not what you want. 

for commands whose alias already exists my script overwrites them if it is sourced before those commands else they overwrite this file commands

find in files according to their size (find in small dirs first)
