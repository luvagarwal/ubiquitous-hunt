I give preference to ftype="d" (the $err string always contains directory word after file word. So ftype is set to 'd'). But this may not what you want. 

problem finding directories having space in them - read the arguments in execute function and escape spaces in them

giving unnecessary new lines. Ex.
$ cmp r1 f2
Executing /usr/bin/cmp /home/luv/testing/r1 f2 
Executing /usr/bin/cmp /home/luv/testing/r1 /home/luv/testing/d2/f2 
/home/luv/testing/r1 /home/luv/testing/d2/f2 differ: byte 4, line 1
NEWLINE

for commands whose alias already exists my script overwrites them if it is sourced before those commands else they overwrite this file commands

find in files according to their size (find in small dirs first)
